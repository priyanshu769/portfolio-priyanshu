    <p>Leaning all the CSS seems unachievable but learning it to an extent where using and applying it to our website, is important. So to do that there are a few simple steps that will eventually lead us to the path which clears the &quot;<strong>CSS Concept</strong>&quot;.</p>
    <h2>Steps to the path:</h2>
    <p>These steps can only be followed, if you are familiar with CSS a little already.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Go to a simple website that you like or use regularly. You can choose any social media platform until it&#39;s not complicated or you can also go for any website (it&#39;ll be even better if it&#39;s unpopular).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Start making a component library by replicating the links, sections and buttons or what ever that website contains.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>While you are making the component library, make sure you are doing it in a form that you can use it later anywhere you want.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now, it&#39;s definite that you&#39;ll get stuck somewhere. That&#39;s the point you want to push and learn a bit more to improve. And here comes the trick, &quot;drum rolls please&quot;.
    <br>
    Look at the source code of the object you are replicating.
    <br>
    Right click on the object and click &quot;inspect &quot;, there will be your code. Look at it, try understanding it and replicating it in your component library.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>That&#39;s it, doing it for a few website will shape your CSS skill in a good way and make you write a better CSS for life. Practicing it this way will lead you to clear concept of CSS.</p>
